### What I learned

I refined and learned more about using display: flex with justify-content and align-items. I had a preconception that using pixels were bad and that it would make the page unresponsive and I broke that preconception during this challenge. I learned that they are fine to use and you just have to know when and how to use them. I still need to learn how to make the page responsive for mobile phones, as on my Iphone the page fits right up to the screen without any visible background and the border-radius on the image is non-existent. This was a step up from the QR code challenge and I learned and refined my skills. I also got to work with using hover and how you should make the hovers look. Using hsl colors is really efficient due to the lightness setting and it allows for you to easily get different variations of the same color.
